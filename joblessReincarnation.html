            <p>Despite being bullied, scorned, and oppressed all of his life, a thirty-four-year-old shut-in still found
                the resolve to attempt something heroic—only for it to end in a tragic accident. But in a twist of fate,
                he awakens in another world as Rudeus Greyrat, starting life again as a baby born to two loving parents.

                Preserving his memories and knowledge from his previous life, Rudeus quickly adapts to his new
                environment. With the mind of a grown adult, he starts to display magical talent that exceeds all
                expectations, honing his skill with the help of a mage named Roxy Migurdia. Rudeus learns swordplay from
                his father, Paul, and meets Sylphiette, a girl his age who quickly becomes his closest friend.

                As Rudeus' second chance at life begins, he tries to make the most of his new opportunity while
                conquering his traumatic past. And perhaps, one day, he may find the one thing he could not find in his
                old world—love.

            <h2 class="fontLuckiestGuy">My Review</h2>
            <p>The animation, the story is just *chef's kiss*. The plot, backstories, character development is just
                great and I'm so glad that it isn't so basic and generic like typical <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai" class="pHyperlink">Isekais</a> nowadays. All in all I definitely would
                recommend this to everyone, 10/10</p>
