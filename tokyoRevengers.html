            <p>Takemichi Hanagaki’s second year of middle school was the highest point in his life. He had respect, a
                gang
                of friends he could count on, and even a girlfriend. But that was twelve years ago. Today, he’s a
                nobody: a
                washed-up nonentity made fun of by children and always forced to apologize to his younger boss. A sudden
                news report on the Tokyo Manji Gang’s cruel murder of the only girlfriend he ever had alongside her
                brother
                only adds insult to injury. Half a second before a train ends his pitiful life for good, Takemichi
                flashes
                back to that same day twelve years ago, when he was still dating Hinata Tachibana.

                After being forced to relive the very same day that began his downward spiral, Takemichi meets Hinata’s
                younger brother. Without thinking, he admits to his seeming death before flashing back to the past.
                Takemichi urges him to protect his sister before inexplicably returning to the future. Miraculously, he
                isn’t dead. Stranger still, the future has changed. It seems as though Takemichi can alter the flow of
                time.
                Given the chance to prevent his ex-girlfriend’s tragic death at the hands of the Tokyo Manji Gang,
                Takemichi
                decides to fly through time to change the course of the future.

            <h2 class="fontLuckiestGuy">My Review</h2>
            <p>I did have my doubts considering it was quite hyped/anticipated because the beginning/first few episodes
                were kinda boring, and since there weren't much seasonal animes that particularly interested me at the
                time, I decided to stick with it, and thankfully I did! It does have some great twists and the plot is
                pretty interesting. Character deveplopment/backstories are kinda alright, logical in a sense? Also kinda
                nonsensical considering they're 15 year olds, you'll understand what I'm talking about once you start
                watching/if you ever decide to. Overall I would rate this a 7/10.</p>
